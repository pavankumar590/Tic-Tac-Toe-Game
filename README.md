In a frontend-based Tic-Tac-Toe game, the user interface (UI) is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive experience.
HTML: Defines the game board using a 3x3 grid structure.
CSS: Styles the board, buttons, and animations for a visually appealing layout.
JavaScript: Handles game logic, player turns, win conditions, and interactions (e.g., clicking a cell to place "X" or "O").
The game updates dynamically without reloading the page, providing real-time feedback to players. Additional enhancements like animations, reset buttons, and AI opponents can be added for an improved user experience.
